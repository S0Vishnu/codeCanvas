# 🎨 codeCanvas

Welcome to **codeCanvas** — a colorful collage of random mini projects, experiments, and creative code snippets. This repo is my digital sketchbook where I tinker with new ideas, try out technologies, and build just for the fun of it.

## ✨ What's Inside

You'll find a variety of bite-sized projects here, including but not limited to:

- 💻 Mini web apps
- 🧩 Algorithm experiments
- 🎮 Tiny games
- 📊 Data visualizations
- ⚙️ API play-arounds
- 🎨 UI/UX prototypes

Each folder is a self-contained project with its own `README` (if necessary), and may use different tech stacks depending on the idea.

## 🧠 Purpose

This repo serves as:
- A playground to learn and explore new tech
- A showcase of creative and technical mini builds
- A reference library for patterns, tools, and experiments

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Some technologies and tools used across the projects:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React
- Node.js, Express, Python
- APIs, Canvas, WebGL
- Git, GitHub, VS Code

(Each project will list its specific stack.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/S0Vishnu/codeCanvas.git
